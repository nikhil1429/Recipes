        <h3>Preprations -</h3>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients. </li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. </li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 
                1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, 
                for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally. 
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
            </li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise 
                over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
                mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
            </li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, 
                either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. 
            </li>
